 Air pollutants and their adverse impacts on public health have been extensively considered in environmental epidemiology 
studies. Human health risk models with short-term air pollutant exposure have been of research interest for years, and the statistical 
methodologies have been developed, both univariate models and multivariate models which consider the joint-effects of air pollutants. 
However, the challenge of including multiple pollutants simultaneously for health risk assessment still exists, especially considering the 
problems of statistical interaction of pollutants, risk factor selection, and variable dimension reduction. This work presents a mutual 
information based correlation analysis of air pollutants in Toronto, ON, Canada with the purpose of facilitating risk factor selection in 
multi-pollutant health risk models. In this work, the air pollutants datasets from the Canadian National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) 
Program  are  prepared,  and  mutual  information  based  correlation  of  different  air  pollutants  are  analysed.  Results  show  that  mutual 
information can provide effective dependency evaluation of air pollutants, allowing for more targeted and strategic variable selection for 
health risk models.
